# SteamEMU-early-access
This is my new project which focuses on Emulation for the Steam Deck's OS, SteamOS 3.0

This is not ready for linux yet, but if the sorce code is changed, could be added. it is windows 11(or above) only.
This based on qemu, python, the recovery image and most importantly , WSL2 (ubuntu)

to install it, first open
Turn Windows features on or off
then select Windows subsystem for linux
then restart
```
wsl --install
```
