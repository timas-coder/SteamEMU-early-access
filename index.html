    <h2>About SteamEMU</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Add project details and description here -->
      SteamEMU is an open-source project aimed at emulating the Steam Deck's operating system, SteamOS 3.0(maybe even 3.5). 
      It allows users to experience the Steam Deck's interface and functionality on their existing hardware, as you know, steam added the deck interface as big picture, but this is just a nice project to do to and update.

    <h2>Project Status and Updates</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Add project status and updates here -->
      Stay tuned for the latest project updates and announcements on the announcements on the announcements tap. I am weekly working on improving the SteamEMU experience and adding new features to my gui(like adding booting to steamos main, and fixing gamescope to work with qemu.).
